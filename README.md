# CSS 360 - Project 3: Tamagotchi Game

## Introduction
Our project will be to build a Tamagotchi-type game. This means creating a game where the player can take care of a digital pet that will rely on how long the player will play the game. Over time, the longer the user will play, they can gain coins the longer they play to spend their in-game currency on things like outfits, better food choices, and more basic necessities. If the player were to neglect the pet, over time, their health will deplete and it will be possible for the pet to pass away.

## Time System
There a shopping system where you can buy food and other necessities for your pet. In-game currency is given to the player over time. This depends on real world time, so time spent between sessions, while the game is not running, will be considered. This will also affect if the user neglects their pet. If they neglect their pet for a certain amount of time, it's possible for their health to deplete and die. This is also based on real world time.

## Implementation
We will develop this game through Godot in C++. Through the game engine, we'll be able to develop save files, replicate real world time, and have a user-computer interaction into the game. One of our gaols is to impelement the time tracking system so that constantly playing the game can effect your pet. We want users to be able to play this one a website or even one of our big goals is to implement this into an app. 

## Our Team & Skills
We want our team to also learn how to implement these types of concepts while learning how to develop a game. For most of the team, it is their first time ever developing a game, or even their first time using the game engine: Godot.
