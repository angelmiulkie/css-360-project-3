# CSS 360 - Project 3: Tamagotchi Game

## Summary
We have built a Tamagotchi-type game. This is a game where the player takes care of a digital pet, feeding, cleaning, and spending time with it. Over time, the longer the user plays, the more coins they can collect to spend on necessities such as food and bathroom items. If the player were to neglect the pet, over time, their health will deplete and the pet will pass away. 


## Time System
There a shopping system where you can buy food and other necessities for your pet. In-game currency is given to the player over time. This depends on real world time, so time spent between sessions, while the game is not running, will be considered. This will also affect if the user neglects their pet. If they neglect their pet for a certain amount of time, it'stheir health will deplete and die. This is also based on real world time.

## Time and Shop System
There a shopping system where you can buy more food and bathroom items for your pet if been used. In-game currency will always be earned, off and online. Every 5 minutes, 5 coins will be earned. If the user plays for a certain amount of time, they're able to gain coins the longer they play. This depends on real world time. This will also effect if the user neglects their pet. If they neglect their pet for a certain amount of time, it's possible for their health to deplete and die. This is also based on real world time. 

## Implementation
We've developed this game through Godot with GDScript. Through the game engine, we've created save files, replicated real world time, and have built a user-computer interaction into the game. One of our goals is to impelement the time tracking system so that constantly playing the game can ensure the survival of your pet.

## Our Team & Skills
We want our team to also learn how to implement these types of concepts while learning how to develop a game. For most of the team, it is their first time ever developing a game, or even their first time using the game engine: Godot.
